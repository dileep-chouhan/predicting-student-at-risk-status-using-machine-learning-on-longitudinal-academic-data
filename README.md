# Predicting Student At-Risk Status using Machine Learning on Longitudinal Academic Data

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying students at risk of academic failure using machine learning techniques applied to longitudinal academic data.  The analysis involves exploring various features related to student performance, identifying significant predictors, and training a model to accurately classify students as at-risk or not at-risk. This allows for proactive intervention strategies to improve student retention rates and overall academic success.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key performance indicators and model evaluation metrics to the console.  This includes information such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., plots showing feature importance, model performance curves) in the `output` directory.  These visualizations help to understand the model's performance and the relationships between different features and student at-risk status.  The specific output files generated may vary based on the model chosen and the analysis performed.
